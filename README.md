# Scratch-Auto-Follow
Welcome to the Scratch Auto Follow Code Instructions!
If you need any help you can contact me via Scratch: 
https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ScratchConnectBot/

Anyway, lets get to it!
-----------------------------------------------------------
Firstly download or copy the code from here. 
you can use the code in whatever way you like just as long you credit me 
in any public projects e.g: youtube videos
The code itself works by making use of the scratchconnect module.
Download it by doing
	
	pip install scratchconnect

and then in your python project
	
	import scratchconnect
	
if you want the full description of scratchconnect go to https://pypi.org/project/scratchconnect/

How the project works:

In the project there is a long list of usernames called 'usernames.txt'.
The project then just reads off the list and follows everyone on it.
Simple.

There are only two issues with this code...

1. Some of the usernames on the list are invalid (the user has deleted their account)so they crash the project

2. The Scratch moderators do not like you doing 'social actions' so usally your ip adress gets banned. I would recommed using an VPN. It could also result in you getting a ban from the scratch team and your account may get deleted.

IF ANY OF THESE THINGS HAPPEN TO YOU IT IS NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY AND IT WAS YOUR FAULT FOR DOING IT. YOU CANNOT PUT THE BLAME ON ME.
